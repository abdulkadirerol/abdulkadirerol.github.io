I am a second-year MSc student in the Department of Computer Science at [Georgia State University](https://www.gsu.edu/). My research interest broadly lies in computational social science, multi-modal learning, and generative AI models.

I graduated from my undergraduate studies in the Department of Computer Engineering at [Bilkent University](https://w3.bilkent.edu.tr/bilkent/).

Here is a link to my [CV](../files/abdulkadir_erol_CV.pdf).
